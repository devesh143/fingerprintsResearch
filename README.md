# fingerprintsResearch
This is my research done during 3rd year on Contact-based and Contactless Fingerprints and their use in daily life and industry.
The fingerprint classification is conducted on PolyU's (Hong Kong Polytechnic University) research database with 336 individuals. Our approach introduces computer vision pre-processing methods to capture regions of interest in fingerprint images to allow effective feature extraction.

**Objectives**
1. Design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction.
2. Prepare dataset for pre-processing & model training.
3. Tune model (fit) for multi-class classification prediction
4. Evaluate model with the test samples (unknown samples)

**About Project**
1. This was our final year ECE BTech project, which aims to investigate the performance of the state-of-the-art CNN-based Deep learning techniques as an alternative to the conventional minutiae-based fingerprint identification.
2. Our proposed method achieved a classification accuracy of 94.26%.
